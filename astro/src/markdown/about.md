# Code 4 Community

Code For Community's mission is to provide services for the greater Lexington community while also fostering growth of developers both experienced and new.

# Ongoing Projects

Currently, we have 3 projects in the works, but members are more than welcome to bring personal projects or give suggestions for other projects.

## C4C

C4C is the code name for our organization website. This is an ongoing project that will change as our organization grows and is approaching maintenance phase.

## Manual J Calculator

The manual j calculator is a calculator to help determine what type of HVAC system a given building needs. We think given enough time we can create a product that addresses some common UX complaints of current options.

## Prevent Child Abuse KY

PCAKY is a PHP website that we are enhancing. We are helping them figure out hosting options, speeding up their website, and building out some small features on their existing site.
